## Project Overview

---

An app to track your travels and share with the travel community your experiences with a members dashboard featuring a map with a drop pin of each location visited, a status bar to track how many countries traveled to so far, and a subsection with each trip a user has been on with their comments of how the trip went.

This was a collaborative three person project with a 14 day time frame to complete and present our work.

## The Brief

- Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own frontend
