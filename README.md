# Project-2: The Elephant List

- Started off with an idea for endangered animals.
- Built template of app, creating different components.
- Multiple APIs failed to work (requesting access, tokens, etc.)
- Changed to an elephant API.
- Issue with permanent acccess (CORS: Access missing).
- Temporary access made.
- This took us a few days, so we ended up being a bit behind where we had planned.
- We were able to pull the data from the API.
- We compiled a grid full of the elephants.
- From here, we wanted to add a few functions.
- We made a search bar function. This was quite a big block and took longer than anticipated.
- We also made a page for a random elephant. This would generate a random function.

## Installation

```
yarn install
yarn start
yarn add @lyket/react

```
## Successes
Making the most of the data we had available in our API
Working around the the issues we had with the limited requests we had per day
A responsive search function to search the elephant data by name
Generated a random elephant option
Spotted a gap in the market for an wildlife API
A working resources page
A styled website


## Problems / Issues
1. We perhaps were too rigid with wanting to do an wildlife/exotic animal project and should have tried out another API
2. The API did not actually have a lot of data to pull from.
3. The API was semi-functioning, so half the data didn't actually work.


## Additions moving forwards
A wildlife news page
A register and log in function
To get the search bar to display the elephant cards and not just the elephant names
Get the elephant sound button to display on top of the main elephant image
Move search bar to the front page nav bar to will provide better functionality
Improving the elephant cards so they have better styling and flipcard option displaying more data
Adding a better API with more functionality or additional animal API's
Add additional elephant filters such as gender and age
Improve like and dislike function 
Add a top rated elephant function in line with the like and dislike buttons
Add ability for user to add images of own elephant sightings 
Add ability for user to add comments to images, either their own, other users or pre-existing elephants
