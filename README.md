# Project-2: The Elephant List

- Started off with an idea for endangered animals.
- Built template of app, creating different components.
- Multiple APIs failed to work (requesting access, tokens, etc.)
- Changed to an elephant API.
- Issue with permanent acccess (CORS: Access missing).
- Temporary access made.
- This took us a few days, so we ended up being a bit behind where we had planned.
- We were able to pull the data from the API.
- We compiled a grid full of the elephants.
- From here, we wanted to add a few functions.
- We made a search bar function. This was quite a big block and took longer than anticipated.
- We also made a page for a random elephant. This would generate a random function.

## Installation

```
yarn install
yarn start
yarn add @lyket/react

```

## Problems / Issues

1. We perhaps were too rigid with wanting to do an wildlife/exotic animal project and should have tried out another API
2. The API did not actually have a lot of data to pull from.
3. The API was semi-functioning, so half the data didn't actually work.
