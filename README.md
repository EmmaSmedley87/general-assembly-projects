# Project-2: The Elephant List

## A breakdown of our steps

---

- Started off with an idea for endangered animals.
- Built template of app, creating different components.
- Multiple APIs failed to work (requesting access, tokens, etc.)
- Changed to an elephant API.
- Issue with permanent acccess (CORS: Access missing).
- Temporary access made.
- This took us a few days, so we ended up being a bit behind where we had planned.
- We were able to pull the data from the API.
- We compiled a grid full of the elephants.
- From here, we wanted to add a few functions.
- We made a search bar function. This was quite a big block and took longer than anticipated.
- We also made a page for a random elephant. This would generate a random function.

## Our minimal viable project (MVP)

- To get an app that produces a list of elephants
- To be able to view the details about the elephant

## Extra Features:

- A donate button
- A search bar function to find the elephant
- A random elephant 'feeling lucky' function
- Authentication for people to add to the API

## Installation

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Successes

Making the most of the data we had available in our API
Working around the the issues we had with the limited requests we had per day
A responsive search function to search the elephant data by name
Generated a random elephant option
Spotted a gap in the market for an wildlife API
A working resources page
A styled website

1. We were perhaps too rigid with wanting to do an wildlife/exotic animal project and should have tried out another API.
2. The API did not actually have a lot of data to pull from, very limited with what to work with.
3. The API was semi-functioning, so half the data didn't actually work/show.
4. With the limited time, we were unable to do authentification so could not do register.
5. The original API base URL had CORS issue, had to work our way around that.

## Lessons

- We learned how to work in a group, specifically managing the project with GitHub.
- Problems with a lot of public APIs, try and resolve this ASAP for future projects.
- Using Insomnia app to help find a working API.
- Understanding Bulma more.

## Additions moving forwards

A wildlife news page
A register and log in function
To get the search bar to display the elephant cards and not just the elephant names
Get the elephant sound button to display on top of the main elephant image
Move search bar to the front page nav bar to will provide better functionality
Improving the elephant cards so they have better styling and flipcard option displaying more data
Adding a better API with more functionality or additional animal API's
Add additional elephant filters such as gender and age
Improve like and dislike function
Add a top rated elephant function in line with the like and dislike buttons
Add ability for user to add images of own elephant sightings
Add ability for user to add comments to images, either their own, other users or pre-existing elephants
